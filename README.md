# Audio Biofeedback device 
A low cost EMG detection system to detect postural strain on the upper back for a parapelegic client during computer use.

Background on project:
Simon Cox Video Presentation 2021: https://youtu.be/jUxSHcz4N0U

Goals for 2022: 

1. Get more consistent readings (both biceps and back)
    - Implement notch filter
    - Digital filtering (investigate signal processing libraries
    - Replace arduino with teensy (higher sampling rate)
    
2. Improve usability
    
    - Bluetooth/wireless communication protocol
    - Mobile app for notifications etc. (design UI) 
    - PCB V1 in progress
    
3. Power Consumption
  
    - Implement autoshutdown/wake-up on microcontroller to save power
    - Improve power supply to circuit
    
4. Enclosure
    
    - case for breadboard prototype ongoing
    - ease of electrode attachment system

5. Testing with client
